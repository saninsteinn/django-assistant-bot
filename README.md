## Usage Guide

The Django Assistant Bot project provides various functionalities for developing and interacting with a chatbot powered by Django and FastAPI. Below are examples of how to use the core features of the project:

### Starting the Server
After completing the installation, you can start the Django development server to interact with the application:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Visit the server URL in your web browser to access the assistant bot interface.

### Interacting with the Bot
Once the server is running, you can interact with the assistant bot through its web interface. You can send messages and receive responses based on the configured dialog management.

### Using the Admin Interface
You can access the Django admin interface to manage user tokens and oversee bot activity. Log in with the superuser credentials you set up during the installation process. Here, you can manage bot settings and monitor user interactions.

### Sending Requests to the API
The project allows for interaction through its RESTful API. For example, you can send a POST request to the `/api/dialog/` endpoint to initiate a dialog with the bot:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-server-domain/api/dialog/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Hello, Bot!"}'
```
The bot will respond with a generated reply based on the dialog processing capabilities.

### Using the GPU Service
To utilize the GPU service for machine learning model processing, ensure the service is running. The service supports various AI models for tasks such as generating embeddings, document processing, and dialog responses.

### Using RAG Capabilities
The Django Assistant Bot includes robust RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality for knowledge-based question answering:

1. **Document Management**: Upload and process documents through the admin interface or API. The system supports various document formats and automatically processes them for effective information retrieval.

2. **Knowledge Base Creation**: Create and manage knowledge bases by associating relevant documents. These knowledge bases can be used to provide domain-specific context for AI responses.

3. **Improved Query Responses**: When querying the bot, the RAG system retrieves relevant information from indexed documents and incorporates this information into the response generation process, ensuring accurate and context-aware answers.

4. **API Access**: Access RAG functionality programmatically through dedicated API endpoints:
   ```bash
   # Example of querying with RAG
   curl -X POST https://your-server-domain/api/rag/query/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "What are the system requirements?", "knowledge_base_id": 1}'
   ```

By following these examples, you can effectively utilize the Django Assistant Bot to create and manage sophisticated bot functionalities.
